Sample Size Calculations for Stratified IRTs and CRTs

The ui.R and server.R files create a Shiny app that can be used to find the sample size required for a target stratified IRT or CRT via a user-friendly interface. Sensitivity plots and data to the proportion of individuals in a given stratum are also available here. To use, pull these files and the StratCRTfns.R file and run ui.R and server.R in an interactive R session. The app is also deployed on the web at https://leekshaffer.shinyapps.io/stratcrt.
